## How it works

4-Input Digital Key Lock Circuit: This project implements a simple digital key lock using a combinational logic circuit with 4 input pins and 1 output pin. Only a specific combination of these inputs will unlock the circuit (output = 1). Any other combination keeps the output locked (output = 0).

## How to test

The correct input number is 1001. Only this specific combination the output is set to high.

## External hardware

Input: switches, output: LED
